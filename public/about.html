  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyon! I am a Computer Science student and a Web-Developer-in-Training. I am excited to be in this journey to 
  learn full stack web development and I can't wait to show you everything that I have learned and am learning!</p>

<p>In terms of education, I have completed A levels from Anandaniketan School in Bangladesh, studied Economics briefly 
  at Vassar College and then shifted to Computer Science & Engineer Program at Metropolitan University in Sylhet. </p>

<p>I enjoy reading, running, lifting weights, cooking, among other things. I really enjoy meeting new people, so please 
  consider adding me in my socials by hollering at me in my email. Let's connect!</p>
